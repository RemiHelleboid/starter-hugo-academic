abstract: A new method to reliably simulate the PDE and jitter tail for realistic
  three-dimensional SPAD devices is presented. The simulation method is based on the
  use of electric field lines to mimic the carriers’ trajectories, and on one-dimensional
  models for avalanche breakdown probability and charges transport. This approach
  allows treating a three-dimensional problem as several one-dimensional problems
  along each field line. The original approach is applied to the McIntyre model for
  avalanche breakdown probability to calculate PDE, but also for jitter prediction
  using a dedicated advection-diffusion model. The results obtained numerically are
  compared with an extensive series of measurements and show a good agreement on a
  wide variety of device designs.
