abstract: A new method to reliably simulate the PDE and jitter tail for
  realistic three-dimensional SPAD devices is presented. The simulation method
  is based on the use of electric field lines to mimic the carriers’
  trajectories, and on one-dimensional models for avalanche breakdown
  probability and charges transport. This approach allows treating a
  three-dimensional problem as several one-dimensional problems along each field
  line. The original approach is applied to the McIntyre model for avalanche
  breakdown probability to calculate PDE, but also for jitter prediction using a
  dedicated advection-diffusion model. The results obtained numerically are
  compared with an extensive series of measurements and show a good agreement on
  a wide variety of device designs.
