abstract: The statistical behavior of silicon-based single-photon-avalanche-diodes
  (SPADs) is investigated by using self-consistent 3-D Monte Carlo simulations. The
  coupling of Poisson and Boltzmann transport equations allows us to go beyond the
  analysis of avalanche breakdown and its timing and to extend the investigation to
  the quenching of the photodetector circuit. We find out that the quenching of SPADs
  is probabilistic and strongly depends on the surrounding circuit, in particular
  on the so-called quenching resistance. Independently of the SPAD deadtime, it appears
  that the extinction time needed to suppress any avalanche event may vary over a
  very large range.
