abstract: A semi-empirical model for the optical properties of SiGe alloys is proposed,
  based on physical considerations and the summation of Tauc-Lorentz and parametric
  oscillators. The key parameters of the oscillators are intuited from the optical
  transition and the symmetry points in the band structure. The model is fitted on
  extensive experimental data, for different temperatures, germanium concentrations
  and for both unstrained and strained on (100) Silicium wafer cases. This model can
  be used in optical simulation tools, in order to help the design of optoelectronic
  devices based on SiGe materials.
