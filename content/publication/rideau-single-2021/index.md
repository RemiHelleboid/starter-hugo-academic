abstract: Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPAD) are key optoelectronic detectors for
  medical imaging, camera ranging and automotive laser imaging detection and ranging
  (LiDAR) applications. Today, most of SPADs in the Time Of Flight (TOF) market are
  composed of a micrometric Silicon PN junction associated to a proximity CMOS electronics
  biasing the system above the breakdown voltage. These devices present low noise,
  high pixel-matrix integration capabilities, but their Photon Detection Efficiency
  (PDE) is relatively modest in the near infrared operating region (achieving typically
  only few percent at a wavelength of 940 nm). A considerable optimisation of the
  SPAD design is currently on going at an industrial level with a view of increasing
  the PDE without compromising the timing statistic response to avalanche (Jitter)
  and its quench probability. Within these perspectives, standard commercial Technology-Computer-Assisted-Design
  (TCAD) simulations can only provide a limited guidance for technological and design
  splits optimisation since they are based on deterministic solvers that are unable
  to capture these stochastic figures of merit. Since the seminal work from Spinelli
  [1] clearly showing that Monte Carlo simulations predictions can compare favourably
  with experimental measurements of PDE and timing resolution, the Monte Carlo method
  can be considered to be a useful one for the design of improved structures. It has
  been recently applied to optimize the PDE and Jitter of Silicon [3] and InGaAs SPADs
  [4],[5]. In this abstract we report a rigorous comparison between Monte Carlo predictions
  and measurements of PDE and Jitter. We also discuss in detail, the quench probability
  of these diodes once in avalanche. This latter point has rarely been discussed in
  literature and to the best of our knowledge never addressed within a Monte Carlo
  perspective.
