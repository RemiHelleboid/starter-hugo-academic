 abstract = {This paper presents a new method to reliably simulate the PDE and jitter for realistic 3D device simulations of SPAD devices. This method is based on the use of electric field lines to mimic the carriers' trajectories, which allows the transformation of a 3D problem into a multitude of 1D problems. This idea is applied to the McIntyre model for breakdown avalanche probability to calculate PDE, but also for jitter prediction using a dedicated advection-diffusion model. The results obtained numerically are compared with an extensive series of measurements and show a good agreement on a wide variety of device designs.},
