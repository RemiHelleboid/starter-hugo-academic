abstract: This paper presents a new method to reliably simulate the PDE and jitter
  for realistic 3D device simulations of SPAD devices. This method is based on the
  use of electric field lines to mimic the carriers' trajectories, which allows the
  transformation of a 3D problem into a multitude of 1D problems. This idea is applied
  to the McIntyre model for breakdown avalanche probability to calculate PDE, but
  also for jitter prediction using a dedicated advection-diffusion model. The results
  obtained numerically are compared with an extensive series of measurements and show
  a good agreement on a wide variety of device designs.
